# Pizza Palace - Project-1
## First C++ project for CS 101 ##

## Purpose: ##
> Calculate the number of slices a pizza of a user specified diameter can be divided into given a target size for each slice of 14.125 square inches.
> Using the number of slices from the selected pizza size above, determine how many pizzas will be required to feed the number of guests the user enters based on the following 3 possible scenarios.
## Scenarios ##
> | Scenario | Pizza Slices |
> |-----:|-----------|
> |     1| All guests have 3 slices each |
> |     2| 2/3 of the guests have 3 slices, and the rest have only 2 slices   |
> |     3| 2/3 of the guests have 3 slices and the rest have 4 slices       |

## Output ##
> (Part 1) The program should output: 
> 1. The number of slices the pizza of the desired diameter is to be divided into
> 2. The actual size of the slices in square inches
> 3. The size of the resulting slices as a percentage relative to the target size
> 
> (Part 2) The program should output in tabular format with column headings the following information for each of the above scenarios:
> 1. The scenario description
> 2. The estimated number of slices the guests will eat
> 3. Number of pizzas required
> 4. Number of extra (left over) slices
