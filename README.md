## First C++ project for CS 101 ##

## Purpose: ##
> Calculate the number of slices a pizza of a user specified diameter can be divided into given a target size for each slice of 14.125 square inches.
> Using the number of slices from the selected pizza size above, determine how many pizzas will be required to feed the number of guests the user enters based on the following 3 possible scenarios.
## Scenarios ##
> | Scenario | Pizza Slices |
> |-----:|-----------|
> |     1| All guests have 3 slices each |
> |     2| 2/3 of the guests have 3 slices, and the rest have only 2 slices   |
